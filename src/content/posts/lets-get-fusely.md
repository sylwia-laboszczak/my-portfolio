<strong>My first page written in Vanilla JS</strong>


This is my first homework done on a front-end Bootcamp.
The task was to reproduce the view of the side that was placed in Figma. Thanks to use  such  tools like  devtools and the basic skills of using Figma, I was able to reproduce the entire view of the main page.
This website is written in Vanilla Js.
This project was a test of my first steps in a new field. I hope that it's not so bad :)
