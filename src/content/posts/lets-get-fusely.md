<strong>My first page written in Vanilla JS</strong>


This is my first homework done on a front-end Bootcamp.
The task was to reproduce the mockup from Figma into live website using Vanilla JS and flexbox RWD . Thanks to use  such  tools like  devtools and the basic skills of using Figma, I was able to reproduce the entire view of the main page.
This project was a test of my first steps in a new field. I hope that it's not so bad :)
