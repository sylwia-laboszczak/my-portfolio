This is the final project of the UI Designer Course.
Visualization of the apartment rental application.
The purpose of creating this project was the growing demand for renting apartments.
The pandemic, high inflation and rising loan installment prices made people unable to afford their own flat.
More and more people want to rent an apartment than live in  fearing an unpaid loan installment.
The application is designed in two versions for RWD and for desktop.
