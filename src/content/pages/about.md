Hi everyone!

I'm newly minded junior Front-end developer and UI Designer.

In December 2021, I made a decision to change something in my life. After 5 years of work as an accountant and HR, I decided to take up a new challenge and test myself in a completely new field, which is Web Development. First, I signed up for a 6-month frontend bootcamp.
During the training I encountered many new issues, knowned programming tools and met many other IT enthusiasts from different working domains.
As with any new adventures, the first steps are the hardest and in my case it was no exception.
The first classes although basic for a person who had nothing to do with programming, were a challenge for me and came with difficulty.
With every homework and hour spent, and with knowledge gain, I began to see the results.
Hitting your target in one shot is unattainable and very overwhelming.

During my course someone told me that <strong>"Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out"</strong>.
For this reason, every day I devoted my time to studing, building a portfolio, and participating in conferences.
My course ended with a group project, where I learned how to work in a group, I saw how to work with the version control system and what inconveniences may await for me in a future work. After the course I realized that it would be worthwhile to end the UI Designer course because frontend and ui are related to the same issue.
After 5 years of work in accounting, I got used to continuous learning, but after completing both ISA courses, I realized that IT requires a lot more dedication and time. My 5 years of experience in solving hard financial problems under time pressure have strengthened
 my character traits such as meticulousness and punctuality. Therefore, now I feel that the IT industry is great place for me to further develop my soft and technical skills.
