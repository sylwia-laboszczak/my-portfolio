Hi everyone! 

After working as an accountant and payroll team leader for 5 years, I decided to pursue my interest in Web Development, new trends and new technologies. I signed up for a 6-month frontend bootcamp at InfoShare Academy in December 2021.

<strong>Tech skills: React (with styled-components), JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Git Version Control, REST API, Scrum/ Jira, Firebase/Firestore/ UI Designer- Figma/Figjam, Agile and Scrum methodologies.</strong>

<strong>Soft skills: excellent team worker and works well on her own, strong communication, effective time management, works well under pressure</strong>

During my course someone told me that <strong>"Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out"</strong>.
My course ended with a group project, where I learned how to work in a group, share knowledge and collaborate with others. I learned how to work with the version control system and what inconveniences may await for me in the future. After the course I realized that it would be worthwhile to take the UI Designer course as frontend and UI are interrelated.
After 5 years of work in accounting, I got used to continuous learning, but after completing both ISA courses, I realized that IT requires a lot more dedication and time. My 5 years of experience in solving hard financial problems under time pressure have strengthened  my character traits such as meticulousness and punctuality. Therefore, now I feel that the IT industry is great place for me to further develop my soft and technical skills.

I am a meticulous frontend web developer and UI Designer seeking an entry-level position to use my skills in coding, creating the appearance of the user interface, troubleshooting complex problems and assisting in the timely competition of the projects. I am a well organized and highly adaptable individual, who is able to accomplish multiple tasks at ease, without compromising on quality.

Everyday I devote my time to studying, building a portfolio, and participating in conferences. See the rest of my website.

IT is a natural progression for my interests in anything that can challenge me. I’m ready to learn  and grow. I embrace ambiguity and methods that can help resolve it.
